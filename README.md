# Ai-Driven-RealTime-Monitoring-Alert-System
AI-driven anomaly detection and summarization system using Groq API, LangChain, and advanced data simulation.
ðŸš¨ **AI-Driven Real-Time Monitoring & Alerting System
**
This project demonstrates a real-time log monitoring and alerting system using AI techniques:
- Streaming data simulation for server, network, and security logs.
- Anomaly detection using statistical thresholds.
- Real-time visualizations and AI summaries using Groq API + LangChain.

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- Automated anomaly detection across simulated logs.
- Intelligent summarization of anomalies with Groq LLM.
- Trend visualizations using Seaborn & Matplotlib.
- End-to-end system ready for extension with live data streams.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Python (LangChain, Groq API, Scikit-learn)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visual analytics
- FAISS-inspired clustering for similarity detection
- LLM summarization pipeline

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Add your `GROQ_API_KEY` as an environment variable
3. Run the notebook in Colab or VSCode Jupyter environment
